# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: March 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day building a game by applying what I learned in the past week.

**Thoughts**: The problem seemed complex at the start, but as it was broken down into chunks, it was easier to manage.

### Day 6: March 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: An introduction to defining user functions in Python and a new way of writing loops, while loops. Played around a website called, _Reeborg's World_.

**Thoughts**: The final challenge today was a little harder than the previous challenges. Although, I am already familiar with the concepts, I am finding it really helpful to solve the challenges to build logic.

### Day 5: March 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the loops in python, and applied the concept to build a random password generator.

**Thoughts**: The most important thing to keep in mind is the indentation when writing the loops or if/else. Unlike, other programming languages like C++, indentation matters in Python. Today was a little more challenging and it took a while to program the harder part of the challenge.

### Day 4: March 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: An introduction to the List data structure in Python. Also, learned about modules by importing the 'Random' module and using it to generate psuedo-random numbers.

**Thoughts**: Lists in Python is similar to C++ vectors.

### Day 3: March 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to control flow (if, elif, and else statements), and operators in Python.

**Thoughts**: The control flow syntax for Python is different from C++. Indentation is very important.

### Day 2: March 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about primitive data types in Python, and a new way of printing strings using f-Strings.

**Thoughts**: Today was easy as well as I am already familiar with the beginner topics. Nonetheless, it is helping me to solidify the foundations by doing exercises.

### Day 1: March 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Python using Angela Yu's Udemy Course #100DaysOfPython. Day 1 was an introduction to print() and input() functions, and python variables.

**Thoughts**: I have previous knowledge about these topics, therefore, today was an easy day.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
